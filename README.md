# Zarity Health Assignment - Vedant Shrivastava

This Flutter app is designed to display a list of blog posts fetched from Firebase Firestore, with each post featuring a thumbnail, title, summary, and full content. Built using the MVVM architecture and Riverpod for state management, the app ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase. It supports deep linking, allowing users to navigate directly to specific blog posts via URLs (URL used for deeplinking :- https://vite-react-ten-tau-59.vercel.app/). The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across all devices, and includes smooth transitions and animations for an enhanced user experience. Additionally, a Python script was used to populate the Firestore database with sample blog posts, streamlining the development process.
